I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/), advised by [Dr. Vince Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Rogers Silva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cMtwwG8AAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a research engineer at the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/), where I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and analysis.

I used to be an engineer dreaming to connect brains and computers, now I am growing as a scientist attempting to solve puzzles in neuroscience and computer science. My current research interests include multimodal neuroimaging and unsupervised representation learning. To better understand different aspects of brains, I am developing a multidataset subspace analysis framework incorporating both linear and nonlinear latent variable models to identify linked sources from multimodal neuroimaging datasets. Apart from my job, I am curious about biological and artificial intelligent algorithms and systems. I believe that understanding principles of neural computation will help us to develop more flexible artificial intelligence algorithms and build more energy-efficient machines.

Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any questions or collaboration opportunities. I would also like to hear your [feedback](https://forms.gle/rbkPYpf9LxscFWhc7) so I can learn and grow.
