I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Bioengineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Vince Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). Before I started my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at the Child Mind Institute, where I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and analysis.

I used to be an engineer dreaming to connect brains and computers, now I am growing as a scientist attempting to solve puzzles in neuroscience and computer science. My current research interests include multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning. To better understand the structure and function of brains, I am developing subspace analysis frameworks to identify and predict linked cross-modal components from multimodal neuroimaging datasets. I am also working on unsupervised learning models to assist with diagnosing mental disorders. Apart from my job, I am curious about biological and artificial intelligent algorithms and systems, and I believe that understanding principles of neural computation will help us to develop more flexible artificial intelligence algorithms and build more energy-efficient machines.

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss any questions or collaboration opportunities.
