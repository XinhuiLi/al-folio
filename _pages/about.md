I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Bioengineering/Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests focus on multi-modal neuroimaging and deep learning. I hope to improve the interpretability and generalizability of deep learning algorithms for clinical applications and better understand mental disorders. Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/XinhuiLi-CV-09-21.pdf).
