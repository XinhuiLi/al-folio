My name is Xinhui Li (黎欣惠). I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and the [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/), advised by [Prof. Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Rogers F. Silva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cMtwwG8AAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and investigated [interpipeline agreement](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01942-4) at the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/).

I used to be an engineer dreaming to connect brains and computers, now I am growing as a scientist attempting to solve fundamental problems in neuroscience and computer science. My current research interests include representation learning, multimodal neuroimaging, and AI for science. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the brain, I am developing a deep multidataset subspace analysis framework including linear and nonlinear latent variable models (ICA/IVA/ISA) to learn linked and identifiable representations from multimodal neuroimaging datasets. Apart from my job, I am curious about biological and artificial intelligent algorithms and systems. I believe that understanding the principles of neural computation will help us to develop more flexible artificial intelligence algorithms and build more energy-efficient machines. Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any research questions or collaboration opportunities.

I enjoy reading and listening to classical music. I also collaborate with talented artists to create artwork related to my research, such as [Butterfly Effect](https://sciartwonderatl.wixsite.com/sawatl/copy-of-kaufman-hatzell) and [Schizosymphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yph2hXzY9Dc). I am married to [Yannan Chen](https://yannan-chen.github.io/). It is rare to find someone who is genuine and inspiring. It is even rarer to find someone who shares the same dream. I feel fortunate to have found him.
