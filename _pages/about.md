I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/), advised by [Dr. Vince Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Rogers Silva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cMtwwG8AAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked as a research engineer at the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/), where I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and analysis.

I used to be an engineer dreaming to connect brains and computers, now I am growing as a scientist attempting to solve fundamental questions in neuroscience and computer science. My current research interests include multimodal neuroimaging and unsupervised representation learning. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the brain, I am developing a deep multidataset subspace analysis framework including linear and nonlinear latent variable models (ICA/IVA/ISA) to learn linked and identifiable representations from multimodal neuroimaging datasets. Apart from my job, I am curious about biological and artificial intelligent algorithms and systems. I believe that understanding the principles of neural computation will help us to develop more flexible artificial intelligence algorithms and build more energy-efficient machines.

<!-- I feel fortunate to have genuine and inspiring collaborators and friends along the way, especially my partner [Yannan](https://yannan-chen.github.io/index.html), who always reminds me to "focus on understanding the principles".  -->
Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any questions or collaboration opportunities. I would also love to hear your [feedback](https://forms.gle/rbkPYpf9LxscFWhc7) so I can learn and grow.
