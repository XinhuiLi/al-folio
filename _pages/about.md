I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Bioengineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include multi-modal neuroimaging and machine learning. I hope to improve the interpretability and generalizability of deep learning algorithms for clinical applications and better understand mental disorders. I am also curious about neural computation, neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces.

Before I started my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at [the Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/), where I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and analysis.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or would like to discuss collaboration opportunities.
