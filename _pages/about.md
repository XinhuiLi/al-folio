I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/) and [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests focus on multi-modal neuroimaging and deep learning. I hope to improve the interpretability and generalizability of deep learning algorithms for clinical applications and better understand mental disorders. I am also passionate about brain-computer interfaces, neuromorphic computing, soccer and various forms of art. Before I started my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at the Computational Neuroimaging Lab of the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/), where I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and analysis. Here is my [CV](assets/cv/XinhuiLi-CV-10-21.pdf).
