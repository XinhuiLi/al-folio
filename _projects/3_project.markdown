From 2018 to 2019, I worked as a research assistant at [the Hood Visual Science Lab](https://hoodvisualscience.psychology.columbia.edu/), Columbia University. I applied deep learning models to detect glaucoma and evaluated model transferability ([Thakoor et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856899); [Li et al., 2020](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2769404)). We proposed multiple strategies to enhance model generalizability across different datasets and evaluated the impact of reference standards ([Thakoor et al., 2021](https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772481)). In addition, we designed a MATLAB-based deep learning toolbox [Ollie](https://github.com/XinhuiLi/Ollie) to identify glaucoma and won the first prize at Columbia Hackathon.
