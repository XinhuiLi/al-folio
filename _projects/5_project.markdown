This Neuroimaging Method Is Not Duplicated (NMIND) is a collaborative dedicated to accelerating scientific discovery in neuroimaging research responding to the growing frustration about redundancies in effort and the reproducibility of code by independent teams. NMIND seeks to build a community which advances the development of standards in software development, nomenclature, and testing, to ultimately harmonize advancements in neuroscience.
