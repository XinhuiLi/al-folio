Thanks to Georgia Tech Science.Art.Wonder, the talented [Erin Lottes](http://www.erinlottesart.com/) and I were matched to create this piece of artwork "Butterfly Effect" to reflect that fMRI preprocessing pipelines may result in different preprocessed results even when using identical data.

The work is derived from three original views of the brain (center column). Four preprocessing pipelines have been used for this piece, and the resultant images are the first connections to the left and right of the center brains. As the viewer follows the threaded path between images, differences from the original become more and more pronounced. Erin manipulated each of the four preprocessed images for each brain slice through physical means. For some slices, she manipulated the printed image directly, rubbing them with acetone until the paper peeled. For other slices, she embroidered the preprocessed image to a piece of fabric before removing the printed paper. In the most time-consuming process, she traced each preprocessed image, then copied mirror image sketches onto linoleum to produce black prints on white paper. During each step of this last technique, the brain becomes subtly more and more changed, until it is completely different from the original. Each image, becoming more and more distinct from the original, was pinned like a butterfly to the white foam board, and colored thread was used to connect the original to the final and to outline the resulting butterfly shape.
